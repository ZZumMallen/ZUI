# Version 1.1

Added the command `/klg` to change the ui scaling easily

The addon should defualt to a scaling of 0.75 or 75%.
If you want to make it smaller or larger use the command `/klu #`

**Example:**
- if you want to make your UI really small, set the scaling to 50% with `/klu 0.5`
- If you want to reset to standard use `/klu 1` or disable the addon lol
- Want to make it larger? `/klu 1.5`

I kept the boundaries between 0.5 and 1.5 because it gets wild and can impact things weirdly

**If you come across another window that wont scale with the stock Blizzard slider, let me know and I can add to this**
